Hey, I’m **Salah** — a passionate Flutter developer from Egypt 🇪🇬 who’s been immersed in code, UI, and problem-solving since 2017.

I started my journey like many developers do — freelancing, experimenting, breaking things, and rebuilding them better. Over time, those experiments turned into real apps, happy clients, and a growing obsession with writing clean, efficient, and scalable code. Today, I work professionally building cross-platform mobile apps that don’t just *work* — they *feel right*.

## 🧠 What I Do

I specialize in Flutter (of course), but I’m not just “gluing widgets together.” I architect features from the ground up, implement robust state management using **BLoC**, handle API integrations with **Dio**, manage navigation with **GoRouter**, and localize apps using **Easy Localization**. I also love fine-tuning complex UIs with tools like **Syncfusion**, ensuring both form and function are on point.

On a recent project, I built both user and admin apps for an Islamic-learning platform inspired by Duolingo. The work involved supporting a team of junior devs, collaborating with a .NET backend developer, and translating a Figma dream into a fully functional reality. It taught me the power of planning, patience, and why perfectionism *without* planning is a trap (yes, I fell into it).

## 🚀 Philosophy

I believe in building things that solve real problems. I like automation, clean architecture, and thoughtful UX. I care about performance, code readability, and future-proofing — because I’ve been the guy maintaining someone else’s spaghetti, and I wouldn’t wish that on anyone.

I’m also a big advocate for helping junior devs grow. Mentoring and sharing knowledge doesn’t just make the team better — it makes *me* better, too.

## 🎮 When I’m Not Coding

I’m probably reverse-engineering old Flash games (RIP), designing my own game systems, or modding something into a barely recognizable form. Recently, I’ve been reviving *The Last Stand: Dead Zone* with a modular UI system, real-time building mechanics, and more chaos than any game engine deserves.

Sometimes I even remember to drink water and touch grass. But let’s not get carried away.

## 🎯 What's Next?

I'm always looking for new challenges — whether it's building a tool to automate Flutter publishing, prototyping an offline-first communication system, or dreaming up game mechanics that make you say “wait, *that* actually works?”

If you’re building something exciting — especially something weird, meaningful, or just plain ambitious — I’d love to hear about it.

Let’s build something great.
